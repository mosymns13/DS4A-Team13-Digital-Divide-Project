# DS4A-Team13-Digital-Divide-Project
For the Data Science for All (Empowerment Fellowship), a group of individuals in Cohort 3 in Team 13 worked on a capstone project hoping to solve issues around the digital divide in the United States.  

## Repo Organization

- **!Archive** : All old notebooks from our past submissions are stored. We can later delete files no longer needed.
- **EDA Notebooks** : All old notebooks dedicated to intial EDA of individual datasets are stored.
- **Initial Clean Data**: CSV files produced by the `cleaning_all_datasets.py` script (Note: Except the `internet_price_data.csv` is from a different script)
- **Raw Data** : All initial downloaded datasets that have been untouched from the source


## Active files

- `cleaning_all_datasets.py` is the python script with the condensed code from all the individual notebooks from cleaning is saved. This is so that only need to run the script and not multiple notebooks.
- `Key Variables Selection.ipynb` is the notebook that takes all that are chosen for initial analysis work. This file needs further review.
- `requirements.txt` holds all the packages that are needed so far. You can add more packages as time goes on and re-run in your terminal as needed
- `initial_analytic_dataset.csv` is the file that holds the varibles chosen from the "Key Variables Seclection" notebook 
- `revised_analytic_dataset.csv` is the file that holds all the data with the additional scoring information for certain key columns


## Reminders
- **DO NOT** commit to directly to the main branch. Work on your own branch and submit pull requests to merge to the main when finalized.
- You are welcome to make edits to the README as needed.
